HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
<br>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup<br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages<br>
HTML elements are represented by tags<br>
HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on<br>
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page<br>
<h3>The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration</h3>
The <! DOCTYPE > declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.<br>
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).<br>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.<br>
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:<br>
<!DOCTYPE html><br>

<h3>What is CSS?<h3>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
<br>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
<br>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
<br>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
<h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
<br>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 
<br>CSS Solved a Big Problem
<br>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
<br>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<br>When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
<br>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
<br>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

<h3>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content<h3>
<br>One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
<br>This example uses the method to "find" an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":
